# Technical Summary - simple-lms

## Architecture Overview

simple-lms employs a modern distributed architecture with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend components. This architecture prioritizes maintainability, scalability, and performance while enabling rapid development.

## Technology Stack

### Core Components

| Component | Technology | Justification |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Frontend** | React + Vite + TypeScript | Robust type safety, optimized build performance |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS 4 | Rapid UI development with consistent design system |
| **Backend API** | Express.js + TypeScript | Lightweight, performant API framework with type safety |
| **Database** | MongoDB | Flexible schema design for educational data models |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Auth | Secure, scalable identity management |
| **Frontend Hosting** | Netlify | Automated deployment with global CDN |
| **Backend Hosting** | Render.com | Simplified container deployment with auto-scaling |
| **Version Control** | GitHub (3 repositories) | Separation of documentation, frontend, and backend concerns |

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Distributed Repository Structure**
   - Documentation, frontend, and backend in separate repositories
   - Clean separation of concerns for different development workflows
   - Independent versioning and deployment pipelines

2. **TypeScript Throughout**
   - Consistent language across frontend and backend
   - Strong typing reduces runtime errors
   - Improved developer experience with IDE integration

3. **MongoDB Data Model**
   - Schema flexibility ideal for educational content storage
   - Document-based structure maps well to courses and resources
   - Efficient querying for complex educational relationships

4. **Firebase Authentication**
   - Offloads security infrastructure to proven service
   - Handles authentication edge cases (password reset, account recovery)
   - Simplifies role-based authorization implementation

5. **CI/CD Pipelines**
   - Automated testing and deployment
   - Consistent quality control
   - Rapid release cycles

## System Components

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with separate dashboards for each user role:

- **Admin Dashboard**: System-wide management and configuration
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Course, resource, and student management
- **Student Dashboard**: Access to courses, resources, and progress tracking

State management uses React Context API with custom hooks for different functional domains, avoiding unnecessary complexity from larger state management solutions.

### Backend Architecture

The backend implements a layered architecture:

1. **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints with input validation
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and external integrations
3. **Data Access Layer**: MongoDB interactions and data transformations

Middleware handles cross-cutting concerns including authentication, logging, and error handling.

### Database Schema

The MongoDB schema is organized around core educational entities:

- Users (with role-based permissions)
- Courses
- Resources
- Classes
- Cohorts
- Calendar Events

Relationships between these entities are managed through reference IDs with strategic denormalization for performance.

## Integration Points

### External System Integrations

1. **Google Calendar API**
   - Two-way synchronization for class scheduling
   - Event creation and management
   - Notification capabilities

2. **AI Assistant (Post-MVP)**
   - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on curriculum materials
   - Vector database for efficient similarity search
   - LLM integration for natural language understanding

### Internal API Structure

The backend exposes RESTful APIs organized by domain:

- `/api/users` - User management endpoints
- `/api/courses` - Course CRUD operations
- `/api/resources` - Educational resource management
- `/api/classes` - Class scheduling and management
- `/api/cohorts` - Student grouping functionality
- `/api/calendar` - Calendar integration endpoints
- `/api/assistant` - AI assistant endpoints (post-MVP)

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented in multiple layers:

1. **Authentication**: Firebase provides secure token-based authentication
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control at the API level
3. **Data Protection**: Input validation and sanitization
4. **Transport Security**: HTTPS enforcement for all communications
5. **Infrastructure Security**: Least-privilege principles for cloud resources

## Scalability Considerations

simple-lms is designed for initial small-scale deployments with clear paths to scaling:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Both frontend and backend components can scale horizontally
2. **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexes for common query patterns
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implementation-ready caching layer for frequently accessed data
4. **Stateless Design**: API designed for stateless operation to facilitate scaling

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture leverages modern cloud platforms:

1. **Frontend**: Static assets hosted on Netlify with global CDN distribution
2. **Backend**: Containerized API deployed on Render.com with auto-scaling
3. **Database**: MongoDB Atlas with automated scaling and backup
4. **CI/CD**: Automated build and deployment pipelines from GitHub repositories

## Performance Optimization

Performance is addressed through multiple strategies:

1. **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting and lazy loading for frontend assets
2. **API Efficiency**: Endpoint design minimizes round trips
3. **Database Queries**: Optimized query patterns and appropriate indexing
4. **Caching**: Strategic cache implementation for static and semi-static data
5. **CDN Distribution**: Global content delivery for frontend assets

## Monitoring and Observability

The system includes comprehensive monitoring:

1. **Application Metrics**: Performance and usage statistics
2. **Error Tracking**: Automated error detection and reporting
3. **Usage Analytics**: Understanding of feature utilization
4. **System Health**: Proactive monitoring of all components

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

Data protection is ensured through:

1. **Automated Backups**: Daily database snapshots
2. **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Ability to restore to specific timestamps
3. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Documented procedures for system restoration
4. **Multi-Region Redundancy**: Critical data stored in multiple geographic locations

## Development Workflow

The development process follows industry best practices:

1. **Gitflow Workflow**: Feature branches with pull request reviews
2. **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E test suites
3. **Code Quality Tools**: Linting, formatting, and static analysis
4. **Documentation**: Inline code documentation and API specifications

## Technical Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **MVP** | Core functionality, user management, courses, resources | Week 1 |
| **Enhancement** | Calendar integration, reporting improvements | Post-MVP |
| **AI Integration** | Intelligent assistant with RAG capabilities | Post-MVP |
| **Advanced Analytics** | Reporting dashboards and insights | Future |
