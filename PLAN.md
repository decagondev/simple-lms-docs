## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Timeline overrun | High | High | Strict scope management, daily reprioritization |
| Technical issues with integrations | Medium | Medium | Early spike on Google Calendar integration |
| Performance issues | Low | Medium | Performance testing throughout development |
| Authentication complexity | Medium | High | Leverage Firebase Auth to reduce custom code |
| Scope creep | High | High | Clear MVP definition, feature freezing after Day 2 |

## Quality Assurance Plan

- Unit testing for core backend functionality
- Component testing for key frontend components
- Integration testing for API endpoints
- End-to-end testing for critical user journeys
- Manual testing for user experience flows
- Performance testing for database queries and page loads
- Security testing for authentication and authorization

## Post-MVP Roadmap

While not part of the one-week implementation, the following features are planned for future iterations:

1. AI Assistant with RAG capabilities
2. Advanced analytics and reporting
3. Content authoring tools
4. Mobile application
5. Offline learning capabilities
6. Advanced notification system
7. Resource recommendation engine
8. Assessment and grading tools
9. Discussion forums and social learning features
10. Learning path customization

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if the following criteria are met:

1. All core functionality is implemented and working correctly
2. The application is deployed to production environments
3. The system can be navigated and used without training
4. Backend API endpoints respond within 300ms
5. Frontend pages load within 1.5 seconds
6. Authentication and authorization function correctly
